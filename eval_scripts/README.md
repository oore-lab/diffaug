# Evaluation 

This folder contains code to evaluate ImageNet-C/R/S/A in the default and DiffAug-Ensemble evaluation modes. We used the code provided by 
* DDA [https://github.com/shiyegao/DDA], 
* DDS[https://github.com/ethz-spylab/diffusion_denoised_smoothing], and
* OpenOOD[https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD] 

for our other evaluations of these trained classifiers.
